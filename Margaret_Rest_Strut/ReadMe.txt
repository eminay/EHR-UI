Rest: Front/Backend work for Psych Monkey
Strut: Front end work Psych Monkey

Please *deploy* applications in the following order

1) Strut
2) WebApplication1

These apps don't connect to each other just yet.
So that's why I am suggesting opening these apps one after the other, 
especially since I want users to get a feeling for the work flow.

WebApplication1- Patient Database and Psych Monkey Care Plan Tool
